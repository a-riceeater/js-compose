# Test

In order to properly use `type="module"` without CORS issues, a web server must be used to host the files.

To run the server, ensure proper node.js modules are installed (express), and run `node server.js`. You can access the `src/index.html` file at `http://localhost:80`.

Update (from future me), due to the transition away from using module, this server method is no longer required. I will update docs later.
